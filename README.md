# AP Computer Science Principles Project

## Overview  
This is my AP Computer Science Principles Create Task project. This simple program evaluates password strength based on specific criteria and gives feedback to the user.  

It demonstrates:  
- **Sequencing**: The program runs step-by-step instructions.  
- **Selection**: Decisions are made using `if`/`elif`/`else` statements.  
- **Iteration**: Loops are used to repeatedly process inputs.

## Features  

1. **Password Strength Evaluation**  
   - The program checks the strength of user-provided passwords based on:  
     - Length of the password  
     - Variety of characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special symbols)  
     - Detection of common patterns or weak passwords  

2. **User Input**  
   - Users can input multiple passwords until they type `"done"` to stop.  

3. **Feedback**  
   - The program evaluates each password and categorizes it as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (re module)


## Purpose of the Project
This project fulfills the AP CSP Create Task requirements. It demonstrates the use of functions, loops, and conditionals to evaluate user input and produce meaningful results.
